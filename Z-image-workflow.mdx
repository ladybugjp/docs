## Workflow Diagram

Below is a reference to the Z-Image workflow diagram you provided. This diagram illustrates how Z-Image models, CLIP encoding, VAE encoding/decoding, and KSampler interact in a typical Promptus/Comfy-style node pipeline.

## Introduction

Z-Image Generation is an advanced image synthesis framework optimized for high‑speed, high‑quality visual outputs. It integrates deeply with the **Promptus** workflow ecosystem, allowing creators to generate images, manipulate conditioning, run VQA models, and build modular AI pipelines using **Z‑Workflows**.

This page provides an overview of Z‑Image Generation, how Z‑Workflows operate, and how they integrate within Promptus.

## What Is Z-Image Generation?

Z‑Image Generation is built around:

- **Z‑Image Turbo** models designed for extremely fast inferencing
- **VAE-based encoding/decoding**, allowing rapid conversion between latent and pixel spaces
- **UNet-based diffusion pipelines** with support for fp8 and bf16 weights
- **CLIP text encoders** (e.g., Qwen3‑4B models)

Z‑Image is typically used for:

- Photo‑realistic portraits
- Product renders
- Stylized art
- Image‑to‑image transformations

Its speed and lightweight model formats make it ideal for real‑time or high‑volume generation.

## What Are Z‑Workflows?

**Z‑Workflows** are modular pipelines designed to run on Promptus to streamline image generation tasks. They combine multiple nodes—model loaders, samplers, encoders, scaling tools, and preview modules—into a reusable structure that allows anyone to:

- Generate images from text prompts
- Enhance or adjust existing images
- Process images through VQA, scaling, or conditioning passes
- Run experiments or batch jobs

Each workflow consists of interconnected components such as:

- **Model Loading** (UNET, VAE, CLIP)
- **Prompt Encoding** (CLIPTextEncode)
- **Latent Sampling** (KSampler)
- **Image Pre/Post Processing** (ScaleDown, VQA, ShowAnything)

## How Z‑Workflows Run on Promptus

Promptus acts as an orchestration layer that:

1. **Loads the user’s workflow JSON** (like the one you provided)
2. **Initializes all nodes**, resolving models and dependencies
3. **Executes the graph automatically** in the correct order
4. **Streams outputs**, including:
   - Final rendered images
   - Intermediate latents
   - VQA text output
   - Debug previews

### Key Features of Promptus Integration

- **Node‑based interface** for building and modifying Z‑Workflows
- **GPU‑accelerated execution** with optimization for fp8/fp16
- **Automatic dependency resolution** for model URLs
- **Live preview windows** (PreviewImage nodes)
- **Upload handlers** (LoadImage)
- **Runtime parameter overrides** (seed, steps, CFG, etc.)

## Example Workflow Structure

A typical Z‑Workflow includes:

1. **Load Models:**
   - UNETLoader → loads Z‑Image Turbo
   - VAELoader → loads Z‑Image VAE
   - CLIPLoader → loads the text encoder
2. **Encode Prompt:**
   - CLIPTextEncode → produces conditioning vectors
3. **Prepare Latents:**
   - VAEEncode for image‑to‑image
   - or a blank latent initializer for text‑to‑image
4. **Sample:**
   - KSampler → main diffusion engine
5. **Decode:**
   - VAEDecode → converts latents to an image
6. **Preview & Process:**
   - PreviewImage
   - imageScaleDownToSize
   - Qwen3_VQA (optional)

These combine into a modular, reusable, JSON‑based pipeline.

## Benefits of Z‑Workflows on Promptus

- **Reusable:** Load, modify, and customize workflows easily.
- **Fast:** FP8 and optimized UNet allow near real‑time generation.
- **Flexible:** Compatible with text‑to‑image, image‑to‑image, and hybrid pipelines.
- **Intelligent:** Integrates VQA models like Qwen3‑VL for contextual reasoning.
- **Shareable:** Export and import workflow JSONs instantly.

## Conclusion

Z‑Image Generation combined with Z‑Workflows on Promptus offers a powerful, efficient, and modular approach to creating AI‑generated images. Whether for rapid prototyping, professional visual production, or experimentation, the ecosystem provides all the components needed to build sophisticated image pipelines.
